🍇 WhatsBerry Server - Local Setup Guide
This guide will help you set up the WhatsBerry Server on your own computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux). This server acts as a bridge, allowing your BlackBerry Classic to connect to WhatsApp.

✅ Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have:

A Computer (Laptop or Desktop) connected to Wi-Fi.

Your BlackBerry Classic connected to the SAME Wi-Fi network.

A Primary Phone (Android or iPhone) with an active WhatsApp account (to scan the QR code).

🛠️ Step 1: Install Node.js
Your computer needs "Node.js" to run this server.

Go to the official website: nodejs.org.

Download the LTS Version (Recommended for Most Users).

Install it just like any other program (Click Next, Next, Finish).

📥 Step 2: Download the Server Code
You need to get the code from this repository onto your computer.

Option A: The Easy Way (Download ZIP)

Scroll up to the top of this GitHub page.

Click the green <> Code button.

Click Download ZIP.

Extract (Unzip) the folder to your Desktop. You should now have a folder named WhatsBerryServer-main.

Option B: The Developer Way (Git) Open your terminal/command prompt and run:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/jackyadav79000/WhatsBerryServer.git
⚙️ Step 3: Install Dependencies
Now we need to install the "brains" of the server.

Open the Command Prompt (on Windows) or Terminal (on Mac/Linux).

Type cd followed by a space, then drag and drop the WhatsBerryServer folder into the terminal window. It will look something like this:

Bash

cd C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\WhatsBerryServer
Press Enter.

Now, type this command and press Enter:

Bash

npm install
(Wait for it to finish. It might take 1-2 minutes to download the necessary files).

🚀 Step 4: Start the Server
In the same terminal window, type:

Bash

node server.js
Press Enter.

Wait a few seconds. A QR Code will appear inside your terminal window.

📱 Step 5: Log In
Take your Real Smartphone (Android/iPhone) with WhatsApp.

Open WhatsApp > Settings > Linked Devices.

Tap Link a Device.

Scan the QR code displayed on your computer screen.

The terminal will say: "✅ WhatsBerry Bridge is Ready!"

🔗 Step 6: Connect your BlackBerry
Now we need to tell your BlackBerry where your computer is.

1. Find your Computer's IP Address:

Windows: Open a new Command Prompt, type ipconfig, and press Enter. Look for IPv4 Address. (Example: 192.168.1.5).

Mac/Linux: Open Terminal, type ifconfig or ip a. Look for the address next to inet.

2. Open the App:

Launch WhatsBerry on your BlackBerry Classic.

Enter the IP Address you found, followed by :3000.

Example: http://192.168.1.5:3000

Click Connect.

❓ Troubleshooting
Issue: The BlackBerry says "Connection Failed"

Check Wi-Fi: Are both devices on the exact same Wi-Fi network? (Not one on 5GHz and one on 2.4GHz Guest).

Check Firewall (Most Common): Windows Firewall might be blocking the connection.

Search for "Firewall & Network Protection" on Windows.

Temporarily turn off Private Network firewall to test.

Check IP: Your computer's IP address might change if you restart your router. Check ipconfig again.

Issue: Server crashes with "Evaluation Failed"

WhatsApp updates their web code frequently.

Stop the server (Ctrl+C).

Delete the folder .wwebjs_auth.

Run npm install whatsapp-web.js@latest.

Run node server.js and scan again.
